Detalhado: Trabalhei na manutenção e no desenvolvimento de novas features de um sistema de gerenci- amento de informações laboratoriais (em inglês, LIMS). O sistema foi desenvolvido em Java, utilizando a biblioteca JavaServer Faces (JSF) e o Hibernate, e foi desenvolvido utilizando excelentes padrões de projeto, o que permitiu que meu trabalho fosse bem fluido. && Breve: Atuei no desenvolvimento de ferramentas em C++ e Python para uma multi-nacional da área de Electronic Design Automation (EDA) (Synopsys). 
 
Detalhado: 421 Tech é uma empresa fundada para atuar como contractor da Synopsys - uma empresa 
líder em Electronic Design Automation (EDA). Fui contratado logo na fundação da empresa, convocado por um professor meu que estava procurando recrutar estagiários o mais breve possível. Meu tra- balho inicialmente era estudar um dos sistemas da Synopsys - neste caso, um emulador de hardware chamado ZeBu - a fim de auxiliar no desenvolvimento de novas ferramentas para o mesmo. Como a 
421 Tech foi a primeira empresa vinculada à Synopsys no Brasil, quase todo o nosso trabalho era em ambiente remoto (no terminal da Synopsys) e em constante contato com equipes de diversos países 
(principalmente India). Foi um trabalho interessante especialmente no que se refere ao contato con- stante com estrangeiros, e cheguei a trabalhar na própria sede da empresa em Mountain View em 
janeiro deste ano, onde me foram atribuídas tarefas mais relevantes como automatizar o binding de bibliotecas C++ para TCL. && Breve: Atuei em diversos projetos do setor de desenvolvimento da empresa, em um ambiente de alta produtividade, trabalhando com back ends em C++, Lua e PHP, front ends em Java e Bootstrap, bancos de dados SQL e NoSQL (MongoDB) e com ferramentas como o Git, Gerrit (code review) e o JIRA. 
 
Detalhado: MAV Tecnologia é uma empresa que desenvolve ferramentas de segurança web e provê um serviço de e-mails chamado Supramail. Fui contratado pela empresa para trabalhar em uma com- pleta reformulação do Supramail, cujo era por eles considerado mal projetado. Atuei tanto no projeto quanto no desenvolvimento do novo sistema, que foi desenvolvido utilizando uma API proprietária em C++ com bindings para Lua que continha inúmeras ferramentas de networking, bancos de dados, criptografia, compressão, logging, multi-threading, encoding, etc. O front end foi inteiramente desen- volvido em Java. Como se tratava de um serviço em massa, havia também uma equipe independente 
que trabalhava na infraestrutura Linux do cluster onde o serviço seria colocado no ar. Trabalhávamos em sprints de duas semanas utilizando o Git para o controle de versão e o Gerrit para code review. 
Desenvolvemos servidores HTTP e SMTP do zero, bem como proxies IMAP e POP3. Após a entrega do Supramail a dedicação da equipe era dividida entre duas tarefas: a manutenção do Supramail e o desenvolvimento do novo ERP da empresa utilizando PHP e Boostrap. Por fim, após a entrega do ERP, ficamos a cargo de expandir as features do Supramail e lançar novas versões. Trabalhar na MAV foi uma experiência muito gratificante e que me rendeu grande parte dos conhecimentos que tenho hoje. && Breve: Atuei no desenvolvimento de ferramentas em Perl e C++, bem como no desenvolvimento de um software completo em Qt. 
 
Detalhado: Atuei no desenvolvimento de um conjunto de ferramentas para processar arquivos de de- scrição de proteínas, inicialmente desenvolvidas em Perl. Com o tempo, no entanto, sentimos que seria necessário maximizar o desempenho das ferramentas uma vez que milhares de arquivos deveriam ser processados. Decidimos reescrever as ferramentas em C++ e implementar uma interface gráfica em Qt integrando todas as ferramentas.

Desenvolvimento de aplicações 
 
Trabalhando como parte de uma equipe de soluções e arquitetura, desenvolvi componentes padronizados utilizados em diversos sistemas, tais como um componente de logging e gerenciamento de erros, e uma aplicação de gerenciamento de execução de processos, todos desenhados utilizando os padrões e melhores práticas voltadas a facilitar o dia-a-dia do suporte a produção. No quesito persistência de dados, utilizei JDBC e Hibernate para bases de dados, e JAXB para XML. Para repositórios de código-fonte, eu utilizei o MKS e o SVN, e automatizei builds usando o Apache Ant e o Apache Maven. 
 
Desenvolvimento em Spring 
 
Minha experiência com o Spring foi focada em soluções de integração, utilizando o Spring Batch e o Spring Integration para desenvolver soluções de Middle Office que mediassem a comunicação entre plataformas de negócios e sistemas legado com o back office, através do uso de dados extraídos de arquivos e bases de dados numa série de processamentos batch noturnos, e também de informações recebidas através de canais online operando em alta disponibilidade. 
 
Desenvolvimento Android 
Desenvolver para a plataforma Android foi uma tarefa que me deu muitas alegrias - trabalhar com RxJava e com o Dagger2 desenvolvendo aplicações comerciais para grandes marcas e startups americanas me garantiu a oportunidade de trabalhar tanto na camada de serviço de seus aplicativos, fazendo uso do Retrofit e de programação reativa para gerenciar a comunicação com o back-end através de chamadas REST, e quanto nas camadas visuais dos aplicativos. Trabalhei com um número de APIs do Google tais quais o Maps e o GCM para Push Notifications, e também trabalhei com features tais qual streaming de vídeo e áudio, video-on-demand, compras in-app através da plataforma Stripe, e mensageria (chat). 
 
Bases de dados  
Trabalhei com Oracle, MySQL e Microsoft SQLServer. 
 
Suporte à Produção 
Tenho experiência como engenheiro de suporte a aplicações para plataformas de negócio considerados de missão crítrica seguindo as orientações de gerenciamento de serviços do ITI, e possuo uma visão ampla dos procedimentos de suporte através da experiência que adquiri atuando em diferentes níveis de suporte a produção. Meu foco sempre é na satisfação do cliente, e na velocidade de entrega dos resultados. Em minha posição atual eu gerencio duas aplicações de alta disponibilidade responsáveis pelo fluxo de transações financeiras enormes, onde tempo fora do ar significa perda financeira. Desde minha entrada na equipe, o tempo que essas aplicações passam fora do ar caiu de doze para apenas três dias ao ano. Também sou responsável por lidar com pedidos de usuários, e assim realizo diversas tarefas com agilidade, desde resets de senhas até investigar queries problemáticas, bem como desenvolver e implantar correções necessárias nessas aplicações. 
 
Capacidade de comunicação 
Sendo parte de uma equipe de suporte a aplicações global, estou acostumado a interagir com pessoas de diferentes regiões do mundo, pois nossos hubs são em Nova Iorque, Londres, Pune, Guangzhou, São Paulo e Vancouver, tendo de responder a linhas gerenciais segregadas. Uma parte significante das minhas responsabilidades é ter de realizar implantações nos fins de semana. Devido à natureza globalizada do modelo de suporte a estes sistemas, é necessário implantar diversos pacotes diferentes ao longo do mesmo dia devido as diferenças de horário entre as regiões envolvidas, assim fazendo necessário que mais de uma pessoa acesse os mesmos servidores com o mesmo usuário. Para orquestrar este processo, eu implementei uma pequena reunião com todos os envolvidos nos releases, onde passamos por todas mudanças que serão implantadas durante o fim de semana, e organizamos quem irá precisar de qual acesso a cada momento, assim efetivamente mitigando o risco de contas serem deixadas trancadas após serem usadas. Desde que aderimos a esta pratica, nunca mais precisamos pedir ao time de administração de redes para liberar uma conta nossa.","Android (2 years), Java Avançado (5 years), Spring (2 years), RxJava (2 years), Google API (2 years), Microsoft Office (10+ years), Windows (10+ years), Linux (5 years), MySQL (5 years), SQLServer (2 years), Oracle (4 years)","IDooh TAXIADV - Curitiba, PR && Mercedes-Benz/Arctouch - San Francisco, CA && Walmart Labs/Arctouch - Sunnyvale, CA && Foneville's Snapfone/Arctouch - San Francisco, CA && Disney/Arctouch - San Francisco, CA && HSBC Global Asset Management - London && HSBC Global Banking and Markets - Curitiba, PR","Líder de desenvolvimento do projeto TaxiADV, fui responsável pelo desenvolvimento de seu aplicativo Android, trabalhando features tais quais conexões REST, geolocalização, reprodução de mídia, cache de imagens, agendamento de conteúdo e agendamento de atualização de conteúdo. Também participei do processo de instalação dos aplicativos nos dispositivos alugados pela empresa, configurando tablets Android para serem executados em um ambiente Android específico e personalizado. 
 
Por fim, também fui responsável por gerenciar o projeto, escrevendo histórias postadas em uma board Agile, prestei uma consultoria geral para o projeto e as equipes de negócios devido a minha experiencia e know how e, mais importante, também me tornei um ponto de liderança e motivação numa empresa recém-nascida e inteiramente composta de jovens adultos que nunca lidaram com algo tão grande antes. Esse comportamento diferenciado me rendeu elogios tanto de meus colegas da empresa quanto da administração da incubadora, tanto que, no final do projeto, eu havia me tornado a referência da empresa tanto em tecnologia quando em liderança em alguns de seus eventos e reuniões de negócios, conversando e apresentando o produto para possíveis investidores e potenciais clientes. A equipe de desenvolvimento foi dissolvida no final de 2016, após implantar o Proof of Concept com sucesso. && Neste projeto de desenvolvimento Android me ví trabalhando com uma equipe multinacional distribuída tal qual meus dias de bancário, com stakeholders no México, em ambas as costas americanas, Florianópolis, e até mesmo na Bielorrússia. Fui encarregado de desenvolver features baseadas em estórias postadas num sistema de gerenciamento de tarefas Agile com o objetivo final de criar uma aplicação de gerenciamento de frota veicular para usuários finais, e fiz a implementação completa de features tais qual o sistema de rastreamento veicular com componentes visuais customizados utilizando o Google Maps e um sistema de Push Notifications, um scanner de código de barras customizado, além de toda a mecânica interna da pesada comunicação com o back-end dessas features através de chamadas REST.  
 
Também fui capaz de identificar alguns problemas com a documentação do projeto vindas da agência do cliente, envolvendo informações conflitantes devido a passagem do tempo entre o começo do processo de desenho do produto e o início do desenvolvimento do mesmo, e com meu olhar aguçado para padrões, fui capaz de rapidamente identificar quais áreas precisariam ser revistas o mais cedo possível na linha de tempo do projeto e levantei essa situação para o meu gerente de projeto, este que então tomou as medidas cabíveis para melhorar a qualidade da documentação e nos poupou uma quantidade considerável de tempo ao longo do processo de desenvolvimento e viabilizou um projeto que possuía um prazo curto e seguia reto em direção a um percurso complicado. && Sunnyvale/ Estados Unidos) 
Participei brevemente de um projeto de gerenciamento de entregas no Walmart Labs, no Vale do Silício na Califórnia, cobrindo a licença paternidade de outro colaborador da Arctouch. Tive menos de quatro horas de handover, mas como eu já estava bem familiarizado com a pilha tecnológica utilizada no projeto (novamente programação reativa), fui capaz de atingir a mesma passada do resto da equipe em menos de uma semana. Fui feliz em realizar pontualmente a entrega de uma tela de pesquisa multiparametrizada particularmente complexa enquanto também provia orientações à equipe de back-end local tal qual a outros membros da equipe de engenharia do projeto em diversas ocasiões. && Curitiba/Brasil - San Francisco/Estados Unidos) 
Um dos membros originais do time de desenvolvimento Android do projeto do Snapfone, fui encarregado, junto com minha equipe, de construer o MPV de uma plataforma de vendas de varejo informal (user-to-user), com um sistema de pagamentos embutido feito em Stripe, além de integração com o Google Maps e um sistema de chat encriptado. Esse foi meu primeiro projeto trabalhando com uma pilha tecnológica que envolvesse programação reativa, com o MVP supracitado tendo sido construído usando RxJava, Retrolambda, e o Retrofit. Sempre um rápido aprendiz, não tive muitas dificuldades e em pouquíssimo tempo dominei a tecnologia, e trabalhei em virtualmente todas as features do projeto, especialmente no sistema de chat e sua encriptação através da plataforma PubNub e também na integração com o Google Maps e seus elementos visuais para ofertas geolocalizadas. && Me juntei ao esforço binacional de desenvolvimento responsável por manter a aplicação Watch Disney Channel na plataforma Android já no fim do projeto, onde pude trabalhar por cerca de um mês. Minhas responsabilidades neste papel incluíam o desenvolvimento e teste de novas funcionalidades ou correções tais quais as estórias colocadas numa plataforma de gerenciamento de tarefas Agile, e tive a oportunidade de trabalhar com a tecnologia de Streaming e video-on-demand antes do projeto se encerrar. && Como parte de um time distribuído global, fui responsável por lidar com todos os problemas relacionados a plataforma de negócio (Charles River IMS) e a aplicação de Middle Office (CADIS EDM) do departamento durante os processamentos dos batchs noturnos e intraday, além de gerenciar quaisquer solicitações de usuários. 
Parte destas tarefas envolviam o uso do Control-M para monitorar o batch de jobs que gerava os relatórios de final do dia. Estes jobs eram governados por um prazo de entrega muito estreito, onde a perda dessa janela incorria em perda financeira direta. Além destes jobs, também fui responsável por suportar o batch intraday, que operava com dados de sistema vivos, e que quando parava de funcionar incorria não apenas em perda financeira, mas também em perda reputacional para a organização. Para evitar estas baixas no acordo de disponibilidade bem como qualquer interrupção em nas capacidades negociais da organização, eu seguia um processo onde nenhum alerta passava sem ser investigado, e gerenciava problemas com diligência, garantindo que nenhum problema resolvido fosse deixado sem uma solução documentada e armazenada no repositório de conhecimento para referência futura. 
Consertar jobs críticos requeria que eu fosse capaz de isolar e analisar todos os logs relevantes, seja no Linux ou nas bases de dados onde os registros de transações eram armazenados, procurando pelas mensagens de erro que apontavam em qual componente interno se originou o problema. Devido a estudo e mapeamento minucioso dos fluxos críticos desse batch, eu era capaz de apontar as causas raízes com rapidez significativa, o que me rendeu elogios de meus colegas de equipe. 
A atribuição final dessa minha posição era lidar com solicitações de usuários da área de negócios (traders, gerentes de fundos e de carteiras de investimento) e de data management. Tais solicitações iam desde responder a perguntas e prover orientações cotidianas até resolução de problemas funcionais no sistema. Dado o ambiente tipicamente agitado dos sistemas financeiros, esta atribuição em particular requeria cuidado extra na hora de lidar com tais solicitações. Numa dada ocasião, um dos usuários precisava contornar um problema ainda sem resolução num componente crucial do batch. Para lidar com este problema de forma transparente, organizei rapidamente uma conferência por telefone para informar de antemão ao usuário o que estava acontecendo com o sistema e qual seria o tempo estimado para que o sistema fosse restaurado. Eles demonstraram apreciar a iniciativa e desde então me tornei o primeiro engenheiro para o qual eles vêm com perguntas, mesmo não sendo o membro mais sênior da equipe. && Fui a primeira contratação de uma equipe composta por mais dois outros desenvolvedores também sem experiência prévia em Spring. O projeto no qual fui alocado era um esforço para migrar um conjunto de aplicações que compunham um sistema Middle Office desenvolvido num framework Java legado proprietário. Toda a lógica negocial seria migrada para um framework proprietário novo criado com base em Spring Batch e Spring Integration. Fui encarregado de aprender a desenvolver em Spring, e a desenvolver um programa de treinamento para novas contratações. Treinei onze novos recursos, incluindo pessoas de mais senioridade que eu, e, da última vez que ouvi a respeito, meu guia e meu projeto sandbox ainda eram utilizados para treinar novatos. 
Pouco após o projeto ter início, minha equipe foi agregada a divisão de Arquitetura e Integração do Global Banking and Markets, onde pude me envolver com o design de todos os componentes padronizados do departamento. Era uma posição privilegiada e que me permitiu implantar melhorias em dois componentes que na época não ofereciam todas as funcionalidades que suas contrapartes dos sistemas legado: o gerenciador de erros, e o controlador de execução de processos em batch. 
O gerenciador de erros era um módulo ""inteligente"" que se anexava sozinho à aplicação, sendo capaz de decidir se o processo deveria continuar rodando ou não após um erro ocorrer durante o processamento, bem como o que deveria ser feito com ele, e por fim enviava um e-mail escrito em ""voz humana"" listando os erros. A versão anterior utilizada pela Arquitetura apenas interrompia a execução, desfazia as transações na base de dados, e enviava um e-mail com a pilha de erros de execução (stack trace). O controle de execução de processos teve de passar por uma longa refatoração, pelo qual fui o único responsável. A versão anterior continha um bug onde o motor do Spring sempre retornava um código de saída (exit code) positivo para o Linux, mesmo quando a execução encerrava de forma anormal. Também adicionei um componente que realizava uma verificação das dependências dos processos na hora de iniciar um novo processo, algo que havia ficado de fora do escopo original. 
Foi nesta posição em que tive meu primeiro contato com suporte a produção, pois fui encarregado de ser o engenheiro de suporte backup de uma equipe de suporte à um sistema front office (Murex) e middle office (Java). Lá, desenvolvi diversas correções e pequenas ferramentas para melhorar a capacidade de suporte do sistema. Promovi a adoção de novos padrões, algo que ajudou no evergreening dessas aplicações cerca de um ano depois.",March 2016 to November 2016 && October 2015 to February 2016 && September 2015 to October 2015 && April 2015 to September 2015 && March 2015 to April 2015 && August 2012 to January 2015 && September 2010 to August 2012,Lead Developer && Android Developer && Desenvolvedor Android && Desenvolvedor Android && Desenvolvedor Android && Support Analyst && Spring Developer,"Curitiba, PR",Universidade Positivo,2011,Bacharel in Sistemas de Informação,None

I usually work with more than one project at a time, playing role as system analyst, developer, architect, and coordinator. In my company sector, I’m the only one responsible for all coding/project merging, testing processes, and code reviewing. 
As the company develops an ERP, there’s no specific client which I’m responsible for. 
There are some projects which I have idealized, for example, a website installer to facilitate the publications and deployment at the clients, performed by the clients themselves or by the consultants of the company. Another example is the automatization process to build the solutions and generate the deployable packages, as the tasks are finished and made available to the clients. 
At the company, there are some employee performance assessment along the year, and I always reached the highest scores. 
 
I appreciate your considering me for one of the positions mentioned. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you need any further information. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Matheus de Lara Calache

Details 
 
I have a more technical profile than functional - sort of 60% technical and 40% functional. I am familiar with several interfaces, package api's and native EBS tables in order to be able to create customizations in several modules. I don't have full functional knowledge to realize all the necessary setup's for a roll-out, such as total functional information in a specific track such as ""order to cash"" or ""procure to pay"" although I am very close to have this in such tracks. 
In the projects I have worked I used to create MD50 detailed specifications from basic business requirements gathered from key users by functional consultant. Then after that I measure the effort to produce customizations and the deadlines and slipt those among the team getting the most complex for coding myself. I have worked in EBS versions 11i and R12 recently. 
 
So, I can detail a little bit more my technical knowledge of modules and overall tables, interface tables and package API's:

Requirement management for custom development on SAP-FI and SAP-MM. 
 
Accomplishments 
I had the opportunity to participate on a delicate project that involved some legal obligations and automation of payment to several suppliers. We had to guarantee that several different acquirement processes entered automatically on their correct approvement workflows. Almost 60% of the company's payments are now able to be processed automatically. 
 
Skills Used 
MS Project, SAP-FI, SAP-MM. && Responsibilities 
My main responsibility at this job was the delivery of a series of improvements to a custom logistics software to a Brazilian company called Petrobras Distribuidora. It was a very small team (2 persons) so I had multiple responsibilities: requirement analysis, modelling and development. Testing was done by the other team member and deployment was responsibility of another team. 
 
Accomplishments 
I believe this was the most relevant job I've ever done because it had a major result on the clients operations. The main improvement made had to be timing efficient as the client had a small window of time between the appearence of the necessity and the actual response he had to do into the system, and we managed to elaborate an efficient one-page-does-it-all pure Javascript interface that enabled him to achieve these goals within the desired time frame. 
 
Skills Used 
Java, Javascript, Websphere Portal, OpenStreetMap. We also had to interface with a pre-existing genetic programming service and I had to study it so we could uncover some of the bugs that needed fixing. Also, it was an almost 100% self managed position. && Responsibilities 
During this time I had my responsibilities shared in two projects: I became coordinator on a .NET software factory for Brazilian oil company Petrobras on a team with 5 developers. Also, I became technical leader on the previous project (software factory for Transpetro) on a team with around 12 members. 
 
Accomplishments 
During this time I was also going through my MBA in Project Management and was able to apply some of my recently acquired skills into my new activities. I had the opportunity to guarantee that the team met the negotiated deadlines and could achieve that by working both as a developer as a team leader and also organizing the team activites. 
 
Skills Used 
Java, C#, Javascript, MS Project, MS Project Server, MS Sharepoint were the technical skills and tools I worked on the period, and I had a big opportunity to develop my organizing skills applying it to both myself and the rest of the team. && Responsibilities 
Responsible for both requirement analisys and programming of Java web applications and maintenance of a Weblogic Portal application at a software factory for a Brazilian logistics company called Transpetro. 
 
Accomplishments 
During my time in these activities I became a technical reference to the team on front end development (mainly Javascript) and could learn and develop my Java abilities. 
 
Skills Used 
Java, Javascript, Weblogic Portal and Oracle PL/SQL were technical skills that I was able to develop. I also got to improve my discipline and organization. && Responsibilities 
Mainly web development in ASP at a software factory building custom systems to Brazilian oil company Petrobras. 
 
Accomplishments 
As my first job, I was able to learn a lot, specially doing maintenance on legacy systems that had poor (or zero) documentation. It required a lot of reverse engineering to elucidate business rules that, sometimes, even the client didn't know anymore.

Database Server: Oracle 10g 
Team Size: 5 
Duration: Jun'08 - Aug'11 
Role: Test Lead 
 
Description: The most important physical asset of all retailers is Inventory. An accurate amount of inventory can make the business just as fast as incorrect inventory can ruin it. 'Allocating' this inventory accurately is a critical process as it ensures that the retailer has ""the right amount of the right products in the right places at the right time"". 
 
The main challenges all retailers face while allocating products are identical, irrespective of whether they trade fashion items or groceries or whether they have a single store or five thousand stores. They fancy a well-organized, perfect method of translating their complicated merchandise plans into store level allocations. 
 
Effectively allocating products is a vital step in the product life cycle management as this is the last chance the retailer gets to send the right product to the right location. If this allocation of goods is done properly, it ensures that the correct amount of the products land up in the right places. On the other hand, if it is done poorly, it can lead to stock outs and lost sales for some items while other items incur high levels of inventory costs by sitting on the shelves of stores and warehouses resulting in consequent returns or clearances.

My main responsibilities are the maintenances of MPLS protocol on Datacom network switches using C programming language for Linux embedded systems and development of test automation 
scripts using Python and/or unit tests in C. To achieve our goals we use agile methods, like Scrum, Kanban and standup meetings, and a Linux development environment with eclipse, vim, SeaScope, wireshark, gdb, git and BugZilla. Also, for the development of an entire FW version, I 
was in the role of Code Integrator, were I was responsible for merging the fixes made by the team in a common branch, testing them and checking if the fixes didn't introduce another failure. If this happens, I should analyze and debug the code, assuring the quality of the changes made by the team. 
Currently working on the project of a new firmware, based on an Operational System architecture, where modules are developed by different teams and grouped later. This is being done in C++. In this project, I'm in the role of developer and also Scrum Master, helping the team to achieve its goals. && I’ve participated on the project OpenScape Desktop Client (ODC), a softphone from Siemens, where I’ve started doing modifications on graphical interface and later I was the only responsible and maintainer of the communication core of the program, containing three modules, named SIP Engine, MSIWrapper and SoftOLA. The first two modules were responsible for establishing a phone call using SIP protocol and streaming media to the other participant (audio using RTP, RTPS and video using H.263 or H.264). The latest module makes the communication with Siemens PABX, using H.323 protocol. I was also responsible for maintaining the interface between these modules and the ODC user interface.  
To perform this work, I used VisualStudio 2005 and 2010, C#, Managed C++, standard C++, C and boost library. To debug and understand problems, I used a lot wireshark to check the message flow, log files generated by the program and core-dump to check stack traces. && On this period of time, I was the interface between Husim users in Munich and development team in Curitiba. My main task was to help the users to identify the problems, checking if it was from a wrong test script, from Husim, from PABX or from the phones. Another task was to help 
users to develop or improve test scripts, analyzing their scenario and proposing the best solution for them. && I worked with Husim team in Curitiba, hired by a third-party company from April 2003 until March 2006, and from this date on as a Siemens employee. The projects I worked on were: 
• Husim tools – These tools were developed in C and was responsible for compiling a script written in Husim language to simulate phone endpoints, sending the script to Husim Server, collecting the results, translating the result from byte codes to human readable text (phone display information by example) and comparing it to a good case checking if some error happened. 
• Husim 5.0 – It was the core of Husim, this project was the evolution of Husim 4, and consisted of a board named HIGate plugged as a main controller of a PABX shelf, interfacing with other peripherals boards on the same shelf and the Husim server located in a Linux PC. The Husim server was developed in C and its graphical interface in GTK. It acts as the brain of Husim, receiving the scripts and controlling the execution by sending the commands to be executed on HIGate. 
• Integrated Test Controller (iTeC) – developed in java as a server – client program, using CORBA to communicate between them and MySQL as database, it was a graphical interface designed to control a scenario test execution, by calling the husim tools to each test on the scenario. 
• Husim Eclipse Plugin – a plugin made to run Husim scripts directly from eclipse IDE 
• Integrated Test Manager (iTeM) – The evolution of iTeC. This program was made on java and used MySQL to store all relevant information about the tests. This program was a complete quality assurance manager.It was possible to insert requirements for a project, create a test plan, a test execution, versions of it, which feature should be tested in a specific version, generate reports and, of course, execute manual or automatic Husim tests, as iTeC did. 
• Husim 5.5 – Evolution of Husim 5.0. The GUI was redesigned in java and detached from the server. Starting at this version the GUI would run in any computer and connect to a remote Husim Server.  
• Husim API – An API made in java, to create scripts using java or any script language that uses java. The officially supported script language was groovy. Also the Husim tools were ported to java, so the execution was made directly from iTeM or Eclipse. 
• SimClient HFA and SimClient SIP – Two applications designed to simulate softphones, using h323 protocol or SIP protocol. Both of them were developed using Visual Studio, C++ and MFC. && Trainee in R&D, developing solutions of Automation Tools for Siemens PBX for Linux and Windows, using programming languages C and GTK. && As a trainee, I did telephonic support for users of Conectiva Linux, new distro testing, bug reporting and Linux administration and configuration;",November 2013 to August 2016 && March 2009 to November 2013 && September 2007 to February 2009 && April 2003 to September 2007 && August 2001 to March 2003 && June 2001 to August 2001,Embedded Software Designer && Development Engineer && Husim User Support && Development Engineer && Trainee && Trainee,"Curitiba, PR","Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná && Universidade Federal do Paraná Curitiba, PR",2011 to 2012 && 1996 to 2003,Software Engineering Specialization && None,None

My main responsibilities are the maintenances of MPLS protocol on Datacom network switches using C programming language for Linux embedded systems and development of test automation 
scripts using Python and/or unit tests in C. To achieve our goals we use agile methods, like Scrum, Kanban and standup meetings, and a Linux development environment with eclipse, vim, SeaScope, wireshark, gdb, git and BugZilla. Also, for the development of an entire FW version, I 
was in the role of Code Integrator, were I was responsible for merging the fixes made by the team in a common branch, testing them and checking if the fixes didn't introduce another failure. If this happens, I should analyze and debug the code, assuring the quality of the changes made by the team. 
Currently working on the project of a new firmware, based on an Operational System architecture, where modules are developed by different teams and grouped later. This is being done in C++. In this project, I'm in the role of developer and also Scrum Master, helping the team to achieve its goals. && I’ve participated on the project OpenScape Desktop Client (ODC), a softphone from Siemens, where I’ve started doing modifications on graphical interface and later I was the only responsible and maintainer of the communication core of the program, containing three modules, named SIP Engine, MSIWrapper and SoftOLA. The first two modules were responsible for establishing a phone call using SIP protocol and streaming media to the other participant (audio using RTP, RTPS and video using H.263 or H.264). The latest module makes the communication with Siemens PABX, using H.323 protocol. I was also responsible for maintaining the interface between these modules and the ODC user interface.  
To perform this work, I used VisualStudio 2005 and 2010, C#, Managed C++, standard C++, C and boost library. To debug and understand problems, I used a lot wireshark to check the message flow, log files generated by the program and core-dump to check stack traces. && On this period of time, I was the interface between Husim users in Munich and development team in Curitiba. My main task was to help the users to identify the problems, checking if it was from a wrong test script, from Husim, from PABX or from the phones. Another task was to help 
users to develop or improve test scripts, analyzing their scenario and proposing the best solution for them. && I worked with Husim team in Curitiba, hired by a third-party company from April 2003 until March 2006, and from this date on as a Siemens employee. The projects I worked on were: 
• Husim tools – These tools were developed in C and was responsible for compiling a script written in Husim language to simulate phone endpoints, sending the script to Husim Server, collecting the results, translating the result from byte codes to human readable text (phone display information by example) and comparing it to a good case checking if some error happened. 
• Husim 5.0 – It was the core of Husim, this project was the evolution of Husim 4, and consisted of a board named HIGate plugged as a main controller of a PABX shelf, interfacing with other peripherals boards on the same shelf and the Husim server located in a Linux PC. The Husim server was developed in C and its graphical interface in GTK. It acts as the brain of Husim, receiving the scripts and controlling the execution by sending the commands to be executed on HIGate. 
• Integrated Test Controller (iTeC) – developed in java as a server – client program, using CORBA to communicate between them and MySQL as database, it was a graphical interface designed to control a scenario test execution, by calling the husim tools to each test on the scenario. 
• Husim Eclipse Plugin – a plugin made to run Husim scripts directly from eclipse IDE 
• Integrated Test Manager (iTeM) – The evolution of iTeC. This program was made on java and used MySQL to store all relevant information about the tests. This program was a complete quality assurance manager.It was possible to insert requirements for a project, create a test plan, a test execution, versions of it, which feature should be tested in a specific version, generate reports and, of course, execute manual or automatic Husim tests, as iTeC did. 
• Husim 5.5 – Evolution of Husim 5.0. The GUI was redesigned in java and detached from the server. Starting at this version the GUI would run in any computer and connect to a remote Husim Server.  
• Husim API – An API made in java, to create scripts using java or any script language that uses java. The officially supported script language was groovy. Also the Husim tools were ported to java, so the execution was made directly from iTeM or Eclipse. 
• SimClient HFA and SimClient SIP – Two applications designed to simulate softphones, using h323 protocol or SIP protocol. Both of them were developed using Visual Studio, C++ and MFC. && Trainee in R&D, developing solutions of Automation Tools for Siemens PBX for Linux and Windows, using programming languages C and GTK. && As a trainee, I did telephonic support for users of Conectiva Linux, new distro testing, bug reporting and Linux administration and configuration;",November 2013 to August 2016 && March 2009 to November 2013 && September 2007 to February 2009 && April 2003 to September 2007 && August 2001 to March 2003 && June 2001 to August 2001,Embedded Software Designer && Development Engineer && Husim User Support && Development Engineer && Trainee && Trainee,"Curitiba, PR","Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná && Universidade Federal do Paraná Curitiba, PR",2011 to 2012 && 1996 to 2003,Software Engineering Specialization && None,None

Lately I've been responsible for the IT trainee supervision, being in charge of training and allocating him to any issue he may be able to solve. && I was technically responsible for the projects I was allocated in, working with web techonologies such as 
Drupal, J2EE, jQuery, HTML 5 and CSS 3. My role started early in the project, during the intake phase, where we had to understand the project and create the scope, risks and the define the team members. 
Before the development started I had to create the testing and staging environment, which included a SVN 
repository, continuous integration server and databases. After the development started I had to make sure the team was following all the technical guidelines, had daily meeting with the client in order to communicate about the current status and dealt with any issues that arose from the daily tasks. The last phase was the go 
live, where the team was no longer allocated in the project and I had to make sure that processes such as load 
tests and vulnerability scans were approved and the entire move to production process had been rehearsed to avoid any gaps. && My main task was to develop and mantain websites, both frontend and backend, using PHP, MySQL, jQuery, 
HTML and CSS. Sometimes I was involved in the infrastructure as well, such as code repository structure and RedHat server management including Apache, Tomcat and MySQL. 
I also worked in a few SharePoint websites doing improvements in both the frontend and backend. && This was a three month project for a highly customized blog using Wordpress. I was hired to create the customized plugins, install and adapt the customized theme and make fine adjustments to make sure 
everything was in accordance to the requirements. && I started as a Systems Analyst, being responsible for the specification and, later, for the development of a 
new version for the live support software sold by the company. Afterwards I was put on charge of the entire 
IT infrastructure, making decisions about the hosting server, development and staging environments and following up with clients about any problems they had with the service. && It was a very small company, five people including myself, and I was in charge of the technical decisions, 
going from the development, internal IT processes, all the way to the infrastructure. Handled equipment and services purchases and supported clients to make sure everything was in accordance to their needs. && Basic web development role, focusing on small LAMP stack websites and some server management to make
